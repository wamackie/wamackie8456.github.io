# Password Generator

## Description
password-generator uses javascript in order to generate a password between 8 and 128 characters long. It was written to give users an instant way to create strong and secure passwords. The user is first asked for the password length. They are then asked if they wish to include numbers, lower case letters, upper case letters or special characters. Once these variables are confirmed a list is concatenated and randomized. The final result is a password generated based upon the inputs given.
